## My Contributions  
As a **Full Stack MERN Developer**, I played a key role in building and optimizing both the frontend and backend of the application. On the backend, I developed RESTful APIs using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, ensuring seamless data handling and integration with **MongoDB** for efficient storage. I implemented **JWT-based authentication** and integrated **Firebase** for secure user management. On the frontend, I designed and developed dynamic React components using **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a modern, responsive, and intuitive user experience. I also optimized state management using **React hooks** and **Context API**, enhancing performance and scalability. Additionally, I contributed to refining the search and filtering mechanisms to improve property discovery. Working closely with my team, I collaborated on GitHub for version control and deployment, while other members efficiently handled UI/UX refinements, database optimizations, and additional API integrations to enhance the platformâ€™s overall functionality.
